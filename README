# brainfuck interpreters

just some random interpreters I've written in other languages.

[main.py](src/main.py): the first version I implemented in Python.

[bf.zig](src/zig/src/bf.zig): second version in Zig.

`src/` contains the source files for the interpreters
`samples/` contains some bf programs I've found online
